# something something nanogemno

To start off, first we must parse some Gutenberg data!  Since I couldn't find
anything that fit the bill, I'm going to parse through the HTM files (since html
is must easier to work with than raw text).

Next? THE WORLD!

## data

Downloaded from:

- http://mirrors.pglaf.org/gutenberg-iso/pgsfcd-032007.zip
- http://mirrors.pglaf.org/gutenberg-iso/pgdvd072006.iso

and extracted out of their lonely ISO containers.
